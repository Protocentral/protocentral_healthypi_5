HealthyPi 5 Documentation
=======================================

HealthyPi 5 is the latest evolution of the HealthyPi series. It is a robust, feature-rich, open-source development board that allows you to explore many different biosignals with minimal effort. Whether you need a simple monitor for a specific vital sign or a complete health-sensor platform, HealthyPi 5 is an extensible solution to to your health-data challenges. Out of the box, it can handle electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration, photoplethysmography (PPG), oxygen saturation (SpO₂), and body temperature data. And it’s easy to upgrade as well! Using the Qwiic connectors on the Pro-Carrier Board, you can leverage external sensor modules to capture and analyze additional biosignals, such as galvanic skin response (GSR), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electromyogram (EMG) data.
